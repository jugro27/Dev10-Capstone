### Group Members: Azure Eller, Juliann Groglio, Seungmin Kim, Widnie Dorilas

Dropout rates are not only an indicator of the overall health of a school district, but also directly influence the amount of funding that a school recieves as funding is primarily based on the number of students within said school. It is in everyone's best interest (the students, teachers, and even governing bodies) to create the conditions that are necessary for low dropout rates. This repository takes an in-depth look at a variety of conditions that affect dropout rates, most notably: racial makeup of school districts, allocation of financial resources, and gender distribution of school districts. We analyzed each of these conditions and their relationship with dropout rates, and we created a machine learning model that predicts the dropout rate for a school district based on all of the features within the data.
