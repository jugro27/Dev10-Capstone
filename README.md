# Predicting School District Dropout Rates 
### Group Members: Azure Eller, Juliann Groglio, Seungmin Kim, Widnie Dorilas

Dropout rates are not only an indicator of the overall health of a school district, but also directly influence the amount of funding that a school recieves as funding is primarily based on the number of students within said school. It is in everyone's best interest (the students, teachers, and even governing bodies) to create the conditions that are necessary for low dropout rates.
